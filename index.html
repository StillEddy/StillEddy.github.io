<!-- <p>
      Hello Users! I am hoping to be a future software developer with experience
      in <b>HTML5, CSS, and Python.</b> I understand how difficult it might be
      to some individuals pursuing the same career as me so I would like to
      share my experience with what I have learned through this page. This is
      also especially useful with the beginning audience and/or self-taught
      developers. I promise that you don't need a certificate or degree to be
      efficient at this. Those are just credibility papers at the end of the
      day, but you can always show your skills through your own work, so here is
      mine!
               </p>-->
